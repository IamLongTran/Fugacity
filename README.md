# Fugacity

Peng-Robinson paramenters include critical temperature Tc, critical pressure Pc, and accentric factor omega(w). This project was initally developed to calculate butane properties. Based on the same computational concept. a more generic calculation tools for all PR gases was developed.
This is an on-going project. The end goal of this project is to determine properties of chemical at 
Ultimately, every gas will have its critical properties table that is expected to be as detailed as steam table.

For VLE calculations:
An extensive use of built-in solver optimization would be used to solve for complicated system of nonlinear equations. A good guess point (T_guess, P_guess) might reduce the calculation process time.


Run/debug script file. Terminal/Console will ask for necessary parameters. Output results will then be calculated and returned.

Furture release is expcted to have
- updated functions added for loops calculations (table)
- bugs fixed (if any)
